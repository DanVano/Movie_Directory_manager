# Movie_Directory_manager

This Python program is still in development to add the ability to move files and folders into a new folder. It is an efficient tool for managing and organizing a directory filled with movie files. Here are its key features:

Directory Walkthrough: The program traverses a specified directory and identifies movie files with .mp4, .mkv, or .avi extensions. Each of these movie files is then neatly placed into its own individual folder, ensuring an organized directory structure.

Subdirectory Search and Organization: The program also searches within subdirectories of the main directory. If a subdirectory contains a movie file, the program will search for a corresponding subtitles file.

Subtitle File Association: In addition to organizing movie files, the program also looks for subtitle files with the .srt extension. If a movie file does not have an associated subtitle file in the same directory or in a subdirectory within the movieâ€™s folder the program informs the user.

By performing these tasks, this Python program provides a comprehensive solution for managing your movie library, ensuring that each movie and its associated subtitle files are neatly organized and easy to locate.
